<p><strong>3.2 Eligible costs on Institute Core Grants</strong>: Institute Core Grants may be used to cover all reasonable operational and research costs, consistently with budgets approved from time-to-time with CRUK.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Eligible costs on all other Grants</strong>:<strong> </strong>For all Grants that are not Institute Core Grants, the Grant may be used to cover Direct Costs and, where specified in the GAL, Directly Allocated Costs. Host Institutions based in the UK may not use the Grant to cover Indirect Costs. Host Institutions based outside the UK may use a portion of the Grant to cover Indirect Costs only if specified in the GAL or otherwise approved in writing by CRUK.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Salaries</strong>: Salary allocation may be used to fund salary and individual employment entitlements for Research Personnel funded by the Grant including, where applicable, annual leave. In the UK, this includes the employerâs national insurance contribution and an employerâs pension contribution, at a rate no higher than that used by the USS or NHS scheme, and outside the UK, at rates no higher than contributions required by statute or available to other employees of the Host Institution at an equivalent level. Salary allocation must not be used:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to offset any prior underfunding of a pension or superannuation scheme;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to pay any bonus or merit awards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to cover any recruitment costs, including any student recruitment costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3.5 Studentship costs</strong>: Where the Grant funds a studentship, virement of funds from the amount allocated for the Studentship to other budget allocations is not permitted without prior approval from CRUK. Grants that include funds for a StudentshipÂ may be used to cover:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a stipend set by CRUK (which must be paid to the student for the duration of the studentship)Â and any paid parental or long term sick leave benefits payable in accordance with <a href="/funding-for-researchers/applying-for-funding/policies-that-affect-your-grant">CRUKâs Funding Policies</a> and paragraph 3.6 below;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the studentâs running expenses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>university fees at a rate no higher than the home/EU fees applied to students funded by UK Research Councils unless otherwise specified in the GAL; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>college fees for the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only those studentships approved as part of the original Application (ie. running expense and salary allocations may not be used to fund additional studentships).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3.6 Paid sick leave, parental leave andÂ other long-term leave</strong>: Where the Grant funds an individualâs salary or stipend, and that individual takes parental leave or other long-term leave, the Grantholder must notify CRUK. The individualâs leave and paid leave entitlements are to be funded as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Occupational benefits for clinical trainees who must change employers in the course of their training:</strong> In recognition of UK-based clinical academic researchers having to change employers during their training, occupational benefits for all UK-based CRUK-funded Clinical Fellows and Clinical Research Training Fellows (ie. clinical PhD students) must be awarded in accordance with the <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/clinical-principles-and-obligations-plus-faqs-2018-08.pdf">âUK clinical academic training in Medicine and Dentistry: Principles and Obligations 2018â</a>. This means that occupational benefits that have accrued as a result of continuous service of employment must be protected, notwithstanding any changes in employer from an NHS Trust/Board to an academic institution or vice versa. These include as a minimum all family and care-related leave and pay (not limited to gender or sexual orientation) and sick leave and pay (irrespective of disability status or health history). Redundancy benefits are not required to be covered other than in accordance with the new employer's ordinary practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paid leave costs for staff at CRUK Core Funded Institutes:</strong> Where the Grant that funds the individualâs salary or stipend is an Institute Core Grant, the Grant may be used to fund the individualâs paid leave entitlements (under paragraph 3.2);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paid sick leave entitlements for staff whose salaries are grant-funded</strong>:<strong> </strong>Paid sick leave entitlements may be charged to the Grant in accordance with the Host Institutionâs usual policy. Where an individualâs salary is part-funded by the Grant, paid sick leave entitlements may be charged to the Grant on a pro-rata basis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paid leave costs for non-clinical PhDs and MB PhD students where:Â </strong>the Grant funds a doctoral studentship; the student is not an employee of the Host Institution and not otherwise entitled to paid parental leave or paid long-term sick leave under the Host Institutionâs policies, and the student takes sick leave or parental leave in the course of completing a CRUK-funded doctorate and while in receipt of a CRUK-funded stipend, the Grant must be used to fund paid leave entitlements for the doctoral student in accordance with CRUKâs Funding Policies. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision applies to non-clinical PhD students and MB PhD students while they are completing their doctorate and in receipt of a CRUK-funded stipend. (CRUK will not fund paid leave during the course of a student's undergraduate medical studies); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Paid parental leave for grant staff and all other paid leave entitlements:</strong> Except as set out in sections 3.6.2,Â 3.6.3 and 3.6.4,Â the Host Institution may not use the salary allocation for that individual (or any other part of the Grant) to fund the individualâs paid leave entitlements and may only use it to pay for cover for the vacant position. The Host Institution must ensure that the individual receives paid parental or other long-term leave entitlements in accordance with its policies for all employees (including without limitation Clinical Research Training Fellows (CRTFs)), and must bear the costs of those paid leave entitlements regardless of the fact that the employeeâs salary is paid from the Grant.Â </p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>have clearly defined procurement procedures and comply with them in procuring the Equipment funded by the Grant. The Grant may not be used to cover any taxes payable due to the Host Institutionâs failure to claim relief on qualifying Equipment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>repair or replace Equipment at the Host Institutionâs cost if it is lost, damaged or destroyed during the Grant Period.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Where the Host Institution is not an entity with charitable status, at the end of the Grant Period, CRUK may require that the Host Institution pay CRUK an amount equal to the market value of the Equipment at the End Date assessed by an independent valuation expert approved by CRUK.</p>
<p>3.11 Access charges: CRUK will not pay access charges for use of Equipment funded by any Grant.</p>
<p><strong>3.12 Transfer between budget allocations (virement): </strong>The Host Institution may freely transfer funds between the salary and running expenses budget allocations set out in the GAL provided that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>transfers are not made withoutÂ CRUK's prior written agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from any amount allocated for the Grantholderâs or Principal Investigatorâs salary;</p>
</li>

<p><strong>9.7 Change in status: </strong>The Host Institution and Grantholder must notify CRUK if there is any change their status, or the status of any Research Personnel, that may affect their eligibility to hold the Grant including, without limitation, a change of control or a change in relationship with any person or entity in the tobacco industry.</p>
<p><strong>9.8 Change in Grantholder:Â </strong>If the Host Institution considers that it is untenable for legal, regulatory, ethical, practical or other reasons for one or more of the Grantholder(s) to continue on in their capacity of Grantholder, then it will notify CRUK of such decision, reason(s) and proposed replacement Grantholder(s). The Grant may be transferred to the replacement Grantholder(s) only with the prior written consent of CRUK and if the replacement Grantholder(s) agree in writing to be bound by the Terms and Conditions. The Host Institution will notify, and oversee a managed handover by, the outgoing Grantholder(s).Â </p>
<p><strong>9.9 Freedom of information requests:</strong> If the Host Institution receives a freedom of information request in relation to any part of the Grant or Grant Activities, it must notify and consult with CRUK on the response to the request.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>10. <a id="#Trials" name="#Trials"></a>Research involving the recruitment of human participants</h2>
<p>10.1 Research involving the recruitment of human participants: the Host Institution and Grantholder must satisfy the requirements in the <a href="/funding-for-researchers/applying-for-funding/policies-that-affect-your-grant/policy-for-research-involving-the-recruitment-of-human-participants">Policy for Research Involving the Recruitment of Human Participants</a> where the research is in the Policy scope, including:</p>
<p><strong>1. Registration of trials</strong>: The Grantholder must register any CRUK-funded or endorsed trial on a recognised trials registry such as the <a href="http://www.isrctn.com/">ISRCTN registry</a>Â or the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov register</a>Â before the first participant receives the first medical intervention in the trial. The Grantholder must notify CRUK of the registration number no later than the time of the subsequent scientific milestone report.</p>
<p><strong>2. CRUK trials database</strong>: Grantholders and Research Personnel conducting trials and/or studies will assist the CRUK Patient Information Team by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>including the URL for <a href="/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial">CRUKâs clinical trials database</a> (cruk.org/trials) on the patient information sheet. (Including the CRUK logo is also strongly encouraged);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing CRUK with the study protocol and patient information sheet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assisting CRUK to draft a lay summary of the trial (and findings, as and when Results are available) for inclusion on CRUKâs online clinical trials database and subsequently provide regular updates to the information so that the database can reasonably be kept up to date.Â </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Collection of NHS numbers</strong>: The NHS number (or equivalent) should be recorded for all patients or participants entering<strong>Â </strong>clinical trials supported by CRUK. The collection of NHS numbers is strongly encouraged in other research projects involving healthy volunteers and any other CRUK-supported study where long-term follow-up is likely. The purpose of this is to enable linkage between routine and clinical data sets.Â </p>
<p><strong>4.Â Reporting of results</strong>: Grantholders are required to make summary results (whether positive or negative) of their CRUK-funded or CRUK-endorsed trial publicly available, without unreasonable delay, and generally within 12 months after the end of research project (unless there is a scientifically justified longer time period). The results should be posted on the same registry as the trial was listed and the trials registry identifier should be used in publications to ensure the results are discoverable.</p>
<p><strong>5.Â Making data sets accessible for further research</strong>: By publication of the primary analysis of the research project results, Grantholders are required to make their data sets available to other legitimate access requests for secondary academic research. They must ensure discoverability of the trial data set (for example through a suitable clinical trials data sharing respository) and have processes in place to manage data access requests and to achieve secure transfer of data where requests are granted. Data must be managed in accordance with our Policy on Data Sharing and Management.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>11. <a id="#NonCDD" name="#NonCDD"></a>Trials supported by commercial entities</h2>
<p><strong>11.1 </strong>Where a Clinical Trial is supported in any way by a commercial entity to whom the Host Institution intends to grant rights to the Results of the trial, the Host Institution must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>notify CRUK as soon as practicable of the commercial relationship and any consideration payable by the commercial entity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly consult with CRUK (or, at CRUKâs request, with CRH) and seek to agree with the commercial entity any arrangements that CRUK (or CRH) suggests;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enter into a fair and appropriate revenue sharing agreement with CRUK (or, at CRUKâs request, CRH) in relation to any consideration received by the Host Institution for the rights to the clinical trial Results (which shall at least reimburse CRUK for the funding it provided in support of the trial).</p>
<p>	Â </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>12. <a id="#IP" name="#IP"></a>Intellectual property</h2>
<p><strong>12.1 Funded Intellectual Property</strong>: Funded Intellectual Property shall, in the first instance, vest in the Host Institution. The Host Institution shall ensure that: (i) the contracts of employment or other terms of engagement of its Research Personnel provide for automatic and immediate vesting in the Host Institution of Funded Intellectual Property. The Host Institution shall co-operate fully and procure that its Research Personnel co-operate fully with CRUK and CRH in all matters relating to Funded Intellectual Property; and (ii) Funded Intellectual Property generated by other Research Personnel automatically and immediately vests on or is assigned to the Host Institution, and that other Institutions co-operate fully and procure that their Research Personnel co-operate fully with CRUK and CRH in all matters relating to Funded Intellectual Property.</p>
<p><strong>12.2 Technology Transfer Agreements</strong>:Â Following receipt of a request by CRH or CRUK, the Host Institution will negotiate and enter into a TTA with CRH in relation to Funded Intellectual Property in a timely fashion. In the event that or once there is no TTA in place, or until a TTA is put in place, Schedule A applies. In the event that there is a TTA in place between CRT and the Host Institution, the terms of such TTA shall supersede Schedule A from the date such agreement becomes effective. If the TTA will expire during the term of the Grant, the Host Institution agrees, at CRUK's request made at any time, to extend the term of the TTA (on terms materially similar to the expiring TTA).Â </p>
<p><strong>12.3 CDD Projects</strong>: Where the Grant Activities involve a CDD Project, the Host Institution will enter into a CDD Agreement. Until the CDD Agreement comes into effect, any Results generated by the Host Institution will be deemed to be Funded Intellectual Property and be subject to this section 12 and Schedule A. In the event that or once there is a CDD Agreement in place, the terms of the CDD Agreement shall supersede this section 11 and Schedule A from the date such CDD Agreement becomes effective.Â Results arising from CDD Projects are confidential and should not be disclosed without the prior consent of CRUK.<br>
Â </p>
<h2>13. <a id="#Engagement" name="#Engagement"></a>Engagement, publicity and publication</h2>

<p><strong>13.2 Participation in fundraising and publicity</strong>: CRUK may use data or other material from research it funds for the purposes of fundraising, publicity, public and community education and engagement, health practitioner education, policy advice and lobbying activities. The Grantholder and CRUK-funded Research Personnel will promote CRUK and its charitable aims by complying with all reasonable requests from CRUK to attend or speak at events, and provide help with images and copy for CRUK publications. The Host Institution will also co-operate in relation to publicity, research engagement and fundraising activity for CRUK. Where CRUK is the largest or most significant contributing funder of the research, it reserves the right to lead on publicity.</p>
<p><strong>13.3 Press</strong>: The Grantholder and Host Institution must contact the CRUK Press Office before making any public announcements regarding the Grant Activities, results or other research outputs, especially in the case of clinical trials. On request, a copy of any upcoming paper with CRUK funding must be shared with the press team at the time of journal submission or when an abstract has been accepted by a conference. When speaking publicly, the Grantholder and Research Personnel should identify themselves as âCRUK-funded researchersâ but be clear that they are not speaking on behalf of CRUK.</p>
<p><strong>13.4 Branding, Communications and Engagement</strong>: Grantholders and Host Institutions must comply with any guidelines for branding, communications and engagement that CRUK may issue from time to time. Host Institutions should ensure that prominent CRUK branding is displayed in CRUK-funded Centres, ECMCs, CRUK Core Funded Institutes and any other place where a major programme of work is funded by CRUK.</p>
<p><strong>13.5 Acknowledgment of CRUK support</strong>: Grantholdersand Research Personnel must acknowledge CRUKâs support (and, where possible, include CRUKâs logo) in all research outputs, including publications, oral or written reports, posters, presentations and information posted on websites that relate to the Grant Activities or Results.</p>

<p><strong>Protection of Funded Intellectual Property</strong>:<strong> </strong>The Host Institution shall, in consultation with CRH, take the steps necessary to protect Funded Intellectual Property as is reasonable to do so with regard to commercial considerations, however it shall not make (or permit others to make) any application for registered protection (including a patent) in connection with Funded Intellectual Property without the prior written consent of CRH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignment to CRH if protection withdrawn or abandoned</strong>:<strong> </strong>If the Host Institution decides to withdraw or abandon patent or similar protection in respect of Funded Intellectual Property, CRH shall be entitled to take an assignment of the property concerned and the Host Institution shall give CRH no less than sixty (60) daysâ notice to allow it to do so effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No exploitation without prior consent</strong>:<strong> </strong>The Host Institution may not exploit, or grant any third parties the right to exploit, Funded Intellectual Property without the prior written consent of CRH. Where CRH consents to such exploitation, it may impose such conditions as it sees fit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Right to call for assignment to CRH: </strong>CRUK retains the right to call for an assignment to CRH of all Funded Intellectual Property. Such right is likely only to be exercised rarely. After such an assignment has been completed CRH and the Host Institution shall negotiate in good faith to agree the terms of a revenue share agreement in respect of net income received by CRH arising from the commercial exploitation of such Funded Intellectual Property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commercial exploitation without consent</strong>:<strong> </strong>If, notwithstanding the prohibition in section 6 of this ScheduleÂ A, Funded Intellectual Property is exploited commercially without CRHâs prior written consent, without affecting any other rights of CRUK or CRH, the Host Institution shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>pay or transfer (as appropriate) to CRH sixty percent (60%) of all gross income and any other sums (whether in cash or otherwise) received by the Host Institution (or by any third party authorised by the Host Institution) from the exploitation of the Funded Intellectual Property, without any deduction of any costs, taxes or any other sums. However, if: (i) a third party contributes towards the directly incurred costs of the research which led to the creation of the Funded Intellectual Property; or (ii) CRUK provides additional funding (over and above the directly incurred costs), then the foregoing revenue share shall be adjusted as CRH deems appropriate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>account to CRH for its revenue share on a quarterly basis, in pounds sterling;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be solely responsible for rewarding the inventors of Funded Intellectual Property out of its share of gross income;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide CRH with a quarterly statement summarising all income received and costs incurred; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that proper books and records are kept (recording all exploitation activities and all income received/costs incurred) and allow CRH access to such books and records as CRH may reasonably request from time to time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer of samples</strong>:<strong> </strong>CRUK encourages the transfer of samples of Funded Materials to academic and other not-for-profit third parties solely for the purposes of non-commercial research, under the terms of a material transfer agreement (MTA). The Host Institution may not transfer or permit the transfer of Funded Materials to any commercial entity without CRHâs prior written consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retention of agreements</strong>:<strong> </strong>The Host Institution shall retain copies of all agreements (including collaboration agreements, material transfer agreements and confidential disclosure agreements) proposed and/or completed relating to Funded Intellectual Property. The Host Institution shall provide CRH with copies of such agreements as CRH may request from time to time.</p>
