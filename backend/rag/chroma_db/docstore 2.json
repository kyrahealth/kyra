Treatment for migraines Migraine treatments include: painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol medicines called triptans medicines that stop you feeling sick or being sick You may have to try a combination of medicines before you find something that works. A GP may also recommend making changes to your lifestyle to help manage your migraines, such as eating at regular times and drinking less caffeine. If your migraines are severe, you might be offered other things to help, such as learning relaxation techniques and acupuncture. If these treatments do not manage your migraines, you may be offered a new type of medicine called a gepant. These work in a different way than other migraine medicines, so may be of more use to you. The Migraine Trust has more information on gepants If none of these treatments help your symptoms, or they're getting worse, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment.

But this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more important or more likely to be cancer. It is important to get any possible symptom of cancer checked out.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also often experienced by women around the time of the menopause. But speak to your doctor if you have very heavy, drenching night sweats, or an unexplained fever. Fatigue There are lots of reasons why you may feel more tired than usual, particularly if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going through a stressful event, or having trouble sleeping. But if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling tired all the time, or, for no clear reason, it could be a sign that something is wrong - speak to your doctor. Unexplained bleeding or bruising Unexplained bleeding or bruising when you have not hurt yourself is important to get checked out by your doctor. This includes blood in your poo or pee, as well as vomiting or coughing up blood. It also includes any unexplained vaginal bleeding between periods, after sex or after the menopause.\u00c2\u00a0 No matter how much blood or what colour it is (blood can be red, or a darker colour like brown or black), speak to your doctor. Unexplained pain or ache Pain is one way our body tells us that something is wrong. As we get older, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more common to experience aches and pains. But unexplained or persistent pain anywhere in the body could be a sign of something more serious. Unexplained weight loss Small weight changes over time are quite normal, but if you have lost a noticeable amount of weight without trying to, tell your doctor. Unusual lump or swelling anywhere Persistent lumps or swelling in any part of your body should be taken seriously. This includes any lumps in the neck, armpit, stomach, groin, chest, breast, or testicle. \u00c2 Cancer symptoms in specific areas of the body: Symptoms that affect your mouth Difficulty swallowing Some medical conditions can make it difficult to swallow. Talk to your doctor if you are having difficulty swallowing and the problem doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go away. Mouth or tongue ulcer or patch that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heal It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common to get ulcers (small sores) in the mouth when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a bit run down \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they usually get better in about two weeks. But you should report an ulcer or red or white patch that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heal after 3 weeks to your doctor or dentist. Symptoms that affect your tummy Persistent bloating\u00c2 It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite common to experience a bloated or swollen tummy that comes and goes from time to time. But if you feel bloated most days, even if it comes and goes, talk to your doctor. Persistent heartburn or indigestion It is normal to feel slight discomfort or pain sometimes after eating a large, fatty or spicy meal. But if you have\u00c2 heartburn \u00c2\u00a0(acid reflux) or\u00c2 indigestion \u00c2\u00a0a lot, or if it is particularly painful, then you should see your doctor. Appetite loss Appetite loss can happen for many different reasons. Speak to your doctor if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not as hungry as usual and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not getting any better. Symptoms that affect your voice Croaky voice or hoarseness Having a croaky voice or feeling hoarse can be common with colds. But a croaky or hoarse voice that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone away should be checked out.
